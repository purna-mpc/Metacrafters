# Creating a Token
"This Solidity program demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality involved in creating a token. It serves as an introductory resource for beginners learning Solidity, offering a foundation for understanding how the language works. The main goal of this program is to generate tokens while familiarizing users with Solidity programming concepts."

# Interpretation
This Solidity contract is a simple example designed for use on the Ethereum blockchain. It utilizes elements such as public variables, mappings, and functions for minting and burning tokens. As an entry-level project, it provides a clear and easy-to-follow introduction to the Solidity syntax. This code serves as a valuable stepping stone for new developers, helping them build the skills needed to work on more advanced blockchain applications in the future.

# Getting Started
To run this program, you'll need to use Remix, an online Solidity development environment. Start by visiting the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once on Remix, create a new file by clicking the "+" icon in the left sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (for example, MyToken.sol).

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.18;

contract MyToken {

// Public variables
string public tokenname = "PURNA";
string public tokenabbrv = "PUR";
uint public totalsupply = 0;

// Mapping to store balances
mapping(address => uint) public balances;

// Mint function to create new tokens
function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
    totalsupply += _value;
    balances[_address] += _value;
}

// Burn function to destroy tokens
function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
    if (balances[_address] >= _value) {
        totalsupply -= _value;
        balances[_address] -= _value;
    }
}
}

To compile the code, go to the Solidity Compiler tab in the left sidebar. Ensure the "Compiler" version is set to 0.8.4 (or any compatible version), and click Compile MyToken.sol.

After compiling, go to the Deploy & Run Transactions tab in the left sidebar. Select the MyToken contract from the dropdown menu and click Deploy.

Once deployed, you can interact with the contract by using the mint and burn functions. Click on the MyToken contract in the left sidebar, then interact with the public variables (token name, abbreviation, and total supply) or use the mint and burn buttons to add or remove tokens.
